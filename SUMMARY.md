# Goodfellow - Project Summary

## What is Goodfellow?

Goodfellow is a unified Cloudflare Worker that processes Brazilian official gazettes. It replaces our previous 4-worker architecture while maintaining the same queue-based reliability.

## Key Features

- **3,107 Cities**: 55.8% national coverage across Brazil
- **20+ Platforms**: Supports SIGPub, Diário BA, DOM-SC, Instar, and more
- **Complete Pipeline**: Crawl → OCR → AI Analysis → Webhooks
- **Queue-Based**: Each execution does ONE job and dies (reliable & scalable)
- **Unified Codebase**: Easy development, testing, and deployment

## Quick Commands

\`\`\`bash
# Development
bun run dev              # Start local dev server
bun run test:city <id>   # Test specific city

# Deployment
bun run deploy:staging   # Deploy to staging
bun run deploy           # Deploy to production

# Utilities
bun run find:city <name> # Find city by name
bun run remote:crawl     # Execute remote crawl
\`\`\`

## Architecture

Single worker with 4 queue consumers:
- Crawl Queue → OCR Queue → Analysis Queue → Webhook Queue

Each consumer does one job and dies, maintaining reliability.

## Documentation

- **README.md** - Full project overview
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Technical architecture
- **QUICK_START.md** - Development guide
- **DELETE_OLD_WORKERS.md** - Cleanup old deployments

## Status

✅ Code complete and ready for deployment
✅ All tests passing (Goodfellow specific)
✅ Documentation updated
✅ Old workers archived

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to staging
2. Test thoroughly
3. Deploy to production
4. Delete old workers (see DELETE_OLD_WORKERS.md)
